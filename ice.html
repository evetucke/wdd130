                        <h4>Prophet Card Project</h4>
                        <p>This was the first of the ICE projects we did in class. This project required 
                            learning how to use basic HTML and CSS to recreate an image of the prophet 
                            card describing President Nelson. This was our first dive into doing HTML and CSS
                            on our own so this was an important porject.

                        <p>This was the second ICE project we did in class. 
                            This project was similar to the prophet card project in that we 
                            were attempting to recreate an image given to us of a card with the 
                            apostles in their order of seniority. This assignment required the use of grid
                            to place the pictures in the correct spots.

                        <h4>Favorite Devotional Project</h4>
                        <p>This project was the first where we were not given an image to recreate.
                            Instead, we were instructed to create a table with information about our favorite
                            devotionals and a form that could be used to collect the information in the table. 
                            This project allowed us to learn how to make a table and form on a webpage, which could
                            be a very important skill to have.

                        <h4>Halloween Project</h4>
                        <p>This project involved changing CSS for a page based on HTML that was given to us. 
                            This let us learn how to use existing HTML to style a page however we wished. 
                            This was a fun project because we were given free rein to style the page as we wanted. 
                            This allowed us to use fun colors, fonts, and other techniques that we had been learning 
                            in class.

                        <p>This project was very grid intensive. We were given an example of a flag and how to create it
                            and then were charged with recreating multiple other country flags. This was a good project to 
                            cement our skills using grid to position different elements on a page.

                            We were given several images that we were supposed to recreate using different colored blocks. We were able 
                            to use several different techniques to recreate these images with let us challenge ourselves with positioning skills.

                        <p>This was our most recent project we completed in class. This project required using all of the skills that we
                            have been learning. We were given an image of a signup form that we had to recreate using CSS and some HTML. 
                            We were then able to see the javascript for this form to see what we could be using in further classes.
