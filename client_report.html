            <h2 class="section_title">Client</h2>
            <p class="answer">As a client for this project, I was able to ask someone to create a project for me to share my crochet projects.
                This helped me to understand the perspective that clients sharing their projects might have. I had to decide what content I wanted to have on this page
                which was fairly simple once I decided what I wanted my project to be. I considered what content similar websites had and decided to model mine after them.
                As the client, I was able to communicate what I wanted my finished website to look like to my lead developer, which we accomplished through email. The website looked 
                to be coming along how I asked fir it, which is great. If I were to hire a team to do a project for me in the future, I would most likely attempt to communicate more often throughout the project.

            <h2 class="section_title">Lead Developer</h2>
            <p class="answer">As the lead developer for Harrison's project, I was able to complete my part of the project and communicate with junior developers through email and in person conversation.
                Communicating with my junior developers was the most difficult part of this project, as I never recieved an answer after attempting to communicate with one of them several times.
                Despite this difficulty, I was able to complete all that I could and sent the link to my client through email. I was able to work on this project through GitHub fairly easily, although 
                learning the commands was confusing at first.

            <h2 class="section_title">Junior Developer</h2>
            <p class="answer">As a junior developer for two sites for this project, I was able to complete the child pages that were assigned to me. I communicated with the lead developers for both projects
                through a combination of texts, emails, and in person conversations. They were able to share what the clients for these projects wanted out of their websites, which made finishing these
                projects simpler. Completing these projects through GitHub was effective, although there was some confusion with one of the repositories at first.

            <h2 class="section_title">General Experience</h2>
            <p class="answer">This project was very helpful to know how to handle any potential projects in the future. The most difficult part of this assignment was having to work with four seperate groups, with people 
                I have not worked with before. This led to some confusion between groups, but we were able to work through it. I enjoyed seeing the website come together as multiple people contributed to it. If I 
                were to do this project again, I would try to meet with group members in person to clarify any confusion for each project. I think I do feel more confident working on real-life projects after this 
                because I was able to gain experience and perspective on what I would do for future projects.
